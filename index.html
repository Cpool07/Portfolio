  <article>
    <h2>About Mike</h2>
    <p>Although I have an Associates in Criminology, I've been working as a Supervisor for a global manufactuaring company for the past 3 years.
Around 5 years ago I was looking for a career change and began to pursue coding, unfortunately I talked myself out of it.
After recently moving with my fiance to pursue her dream job, I was forced to make a career change and feel this is the time for me to begin my journey 
as a Full Stack Developer. In my free time, you can find me either at a local comic book shop or on the leaderboards in a Peloton workout! </p>
    <p>As a student at <a href="https://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I have begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier and grateful for the opportunity to learn and hone my coding skills!</p>
    <p>If you are looking for a new developer or someone to collaborate with, I would love to chat with you!</p>
